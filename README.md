# Maze-Solver-Queue
Data Structure and Algorithm (CSE331) final project, where we develop a Maze Solver application capable of finding a path through a maze from a designated start point to an exit point game using the Queue data structure.The maze is typically represented as a grid of cells, with obstacles and open passages
The application is capable of:
Maze Generation and Visualization:
o Implement a method for generating random mazes
o Display the maze visually on the user interface.
Start and Exit Points:
o Enable users to set the starting point and the exit point within the
maze.
Pathfinding Algorithms:
o Implement pathfinding algorithms to find a path from the start to
the exit in the maze.
Interactive Maze Editing:
o Allow users to edit the maze by adding or removing obstacles in realtime, if applicable.
Path Visualization:
o Visualize the path found by the algorithm within the maze.
